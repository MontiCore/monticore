# MontiCore 3-Level License Model 

[MontiCore](http://www.monticore.de) is a language workbench for an efficient 
development of domain-specific languages (DSLs). All the code available
in these GitHub MontiCore projects  
is published under three levels of licenses as discussed below.

For a full use of generated code in commercial and any other forms of 
projects, the finally generated code is, completely freely available,
even though the main workbench itself has restrictions. 


## License Overview 

The MontiCore Language Workbench deals with three levels of code:

* (Level 3) **MontiCore**: the main libary constituting the LWB,

* (Level 2) **tool derivates** that are to a large extent generated by the MontiCore 
    LWB, and

* (Level 1) **product code** that is finally generated by tool derivates.
    This also includes analytical results, thus as results of consistency 
    checks, code smells, test infrastructures, etc.

Each level has its own and more relaxing license: 

* (Level 1) **Product code**: when a MontiCore tool derivate is used to 
generate code, the generated code is absolutely free for each form of use 
including commercial use without any license and thus without any restriction 
from MontiCore itself. 

* (Level 2) **Tool derivate**: when a tool is derived using the MontiCore 
language workbench, then the result falls under the BSD 3 Clause license 
(see [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-BSD3CLAUSE.md)).

* (Level 3) **MontiCore**: the main LWB components are published in GitHub under the 
LGPL license (see [LGPL V3.0](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-LGPL.md)).


As a consequence using MontiCore during development is rather flexible 
and the final products do not have any restriction. 

Please note that this license level model holds for the MontiCore
LWB and all related projects published in GitHub. For artefacts available 
from other sources, different licenses may apply.
E.g. developers of tools may impose their own form of 
restrictions i.e. licenses on their tools respectively the results
generated by these tools. 
Artefacts directly made available from RWTH Aachen and not published in 
GitHub are for the concretely granted purpose only and are 
not do be made public at all.


## MontiCore 3-Level License on Files 

This repository for the MontiCore language workbench contains three 
kinds of artifacts: 

* Java-files that are executed in the MontiCore LWB. They are under 
LGPL licence.

* Java-files that belong to the runtime environment (RTE) and are thus 
copied to the generated code. They are under BSD 3 Clause license.

* Templates executed during generation. They are also only under BSD 3 
Clause license, because parts of them are copied to the generated code. 

As a result, a tool derivate (level 2) does not contain any LGPL code, 
but only BSD 3 Clause code. Executing the tool derivate then 
produces completely free code (level 1).

If questions appear e.g. on using MontiCore itself in a product
or building an interpreter, please contact monticore@se-rwth.de. 

## Underlying Licenses 

The MontiCore 3 Level license is built on:

* [LGPL V3.0](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-LGPL.md) 

* [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-BSD3CLAUSE.md) 

Please also note the general disclaimer from the BSD 3 Clause license on 
liability, etc. 

## Included Software

This product includes the following software, both having their own licenses,
compatible with MontiCores licenses:

* [AntLR](http://www.antlr.org/)
* [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/)
