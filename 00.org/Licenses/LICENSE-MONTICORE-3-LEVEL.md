# MontiCore 3-Level License model 

[MontiCore](http://www.monticore.de) is a language workbench for an efficient 
development of domain-specific languages (DSLs). 
To prevent too many different public versions of the library itself, it 
is partly published under LGPL.

To be usable in commercial and any other forms of projects, the finally 
generated code is, however, completely freely available. 
Three levels of licenses are needed.

## License overview 

The MontiCore Languag Workbench deals with three levels of code:

* (Level 3) MontiCore: the main libary constituting the LWB,

* (Level 2) tool derivates, that are to a large extent generated by the MontiCore 
    LWB, and

* (Level 1) product code that is finally generated by tool derivates.
    This also includes analytical results, thus as results of consistency 
    checks, code smells, test infrastructures, etc.

Each level has its own and different license: 

* (Level 3) MontiCore: the main LWB components are published under the 
LGPL license (see there).

* (Level 2) Tool derivate: when a tool is derived using the MontiCore 
language workbench, then the result falls under the BSD 3 Clause license 
(see there).

* (Level 1) Product code: when a MontiCore tool derivate is used to 
generate code, the generated code is absolutely free for each form of use 
including commercial use without any license. 


As a consequence using MontiCore during development is rather flexible 
and the final products do not have any restriction.


## MontiCore 3-level License on Files 

This repository for the MontiCore language workbench contains mainly three 
kinds of artifacts: 

* Java-files that are executed in the MontiCore LWB. They are under 
LGPL licence.

* Java-files that belong to the runtime environment (RTE) and are thus 
copied to the generated code. They are under BSD 3 Clause license.

* Templates executed during generation. They are also under BSD 3 
Clause license, because parts of them are copied to the generated code. 

As a result, a tool derivate (level 2) does not contain any LGPL code, 
but only BSD 3 Clause code. Executing the tool derivate then 
produces completely free code (level 1).

If questions appear e.g. on using MontiCore itself in a product
or building an interpreter, please contact monticore@se-rwth.de. 

## Underlying Licenses 

The MontiCore 3 Level code license is built on:

* [LGPL V3.0](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-LGPL.md) 
(for explicietly handwritten Java code) 

* [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-BSD3CLAUSE.md) 
(for templates and all generated artifacts)
