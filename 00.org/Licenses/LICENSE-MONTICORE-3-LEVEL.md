# MontiCore 3-Level License Model 

[MontiCore](https://www.monticore.de) is a language workbench for an efficient 
development of domain-specific languages (DSLs). All the code available
in these GitHub MontiCore projects  
is published under three levels of licenses as discussed below.

For a full use of generated code in commercial and any other forms of 
projects, the finally generated code is, completely freely available,
even though the main workbench itself has restrictions. 


## License Overview 

The MontiCore Language Workbench deals with three levels of code:

* (Level 3) **MontiCore**: the main library constituting the LWB,

* (Level 2) **tool derivates** that are to a large extent generated 
    by the MontiCore LWB, and

* (Level 1) **product code** that is finally generated by tool derivates.
    This also includes analytical results, thus as results of consistency 
    checks, code smells, test infrastructures, etc.

Each level has its own and more relaxing license: 

* (Level 1) **Product code**: the generated product code is absolutely 
free for each form of use including commercial use without any 
mentioning and thus without any restriction from MontiCore. 
Developers may even put their own License label on it.

* (Level 2) **Tool derivate**: when a tool is derived using the MontiCore 
language workbench, then the result falls under the pretty liberal 
BSD 3 Clause license 
(see [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-BSD3CLAUSE.md)).

* (Level 3) **MontiCore**: the main LWB components are published in 
GitHub under the LGPL license (see 
[LGPL V3.0](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-LGPL.md)).


As a consequence using MontiCore during development is rather liberal 
and the final products do not have any restriction. 

Please note that this license level model holds for the MontiCore
LWB and all related projects published in GitHub. For artefacts available 
from other sources, different licenses may apply.
E.g. developers of tools may impose their own form of 
restrictions i.e. licenses on their tools respectively the results
generated by these tools. 
Artefacts directly made available from RWTH Aachen and not published in 
GitHub are for the concretely granted purpose only and are 
not do be made public at all. 

As usual in software development: For statistics, scientific reasons, 
quality and performance improvement, the tools occasionally send the 
fully anonymous statistics report (see file) to the developers. 


## MontiCore 3-Level License on Files 

This repository for the MontiCore language workbench contains three 
kinds of artifacts: 

* Java-files that are executed in the MontiCore LWB. They are under 
LGPL licence.

* Java-files that belong to the runtime environment (RTE) and are thus 
copied to the generated code. They are under BSD 3 Clause license.

* Templates executed during generation of tool code. 
They are also only under BSD 3 Clause license, 
because parts of them are copied to the generated code. 

## MontiCore 3-Level License on Tool and Language Repositories 

Other MontiCore repositories contain complete or incomplete tools as well as
MontiCore language components. They contain again three 
kinds of artifacts: 

* Grammars that are used to define language components in the MontiCore LWB. 
They are under LGPL licence, but these can be extended by own grammars freely.

* Java-files that are executed in the tool (belonging to the tool RTE). 
They are under BSD 3 Clause license.

* Java-files that belong to the product runtime environment (RTE) are 
completely free without restriction.

* Templates executed by the tool during generation of product code. 
They also are completely free without restriction,
because parts of them are copied to the generated code. 


**As a result**, *a tool derivate (level 2) does not contain any LGPL code*, 
but only BSD 3 Clause code. Executing the tool derivate then 
produces completely free code (level 1).

If questions appear e.g. on using MontiCore itself in a product
or building an interpreter, please contact monticore@se-rwth.de. 

## Underlying Licenses 

The MontiCore 3 Level license is built on:

* [LGPL V3.0](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-LGPL.md) 

* [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/tree/master/00.org/Licenses/LICENSE-BSD3CLAUSE.md) 

Please also note the general disclaimer from the BSD 3 Clause license on 
liability, etc. 

## Included Software

This product includes the following software, both having their own licenses,
compatible with MontiCores licenses:

* [AntLR](https://www.antlr.org/)
* [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/)
