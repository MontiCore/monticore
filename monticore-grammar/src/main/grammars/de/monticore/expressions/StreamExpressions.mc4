/**
 * This grammar extends the available expressions with
 * special operations for streams as initially defined by 
 * Broy/Stoelen in [BS01] using the syntax from 
 * Ringert/Rumpe [RR11] and 
 * Buerger, Kausch, Raco, Ringert, Rumpe, Stueber, Wiartalla [BKR+20] 
 * (see https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/)
 *
 * Stream expressions are partly 
 * 1) extending the Expression syntax by grammatical operations (see below),
 * 2) are provided as library of available Stream operations, and
 * 3) are based on the type constructors Stream<T>, EventStream<T>, SyncStream<T>,
 * ToptStream<T> (defined in Types)
 *
 * The language developer may choose the subset of expressions
 * of interest and combine these with the appropriate typing infrastructure
 *
 * This modularity of expressions and associated types greatly eases
 * the reuse of type structures in languages similar to Java
 *
 * This grammar is part of a hierarchy of expressions, which can be found
 * under
 *   https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/blob/dev/monticore-grammar/
 *                 src/main/grammars/de/monticore/expressions/Expressions.md
