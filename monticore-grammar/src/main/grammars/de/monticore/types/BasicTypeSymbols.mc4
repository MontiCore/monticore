/* Beta-version: This is intended to become a MontiCore stable grammar. */

/**
 * This grammar is used to generate an abstract syntax only.
 * These AST-classes are then used to store typing information
 * in the SymbolTable.
 *
 * The grammar introduces the symbols for
 * Types (of all kinds), Functions, Variables and TypeVariables
 *
 * These symbols are of general nature and do not precluse (and thus also
 * not assist) static, private or other specialities.
 * Extensions of these symbols can be found in the subgrammar
 * TypeSymbols that add such specific elements.
 * 
 * These symbols can be used in other grammars, when actual implementations
 * of these symbols become available or these symbols need to be imported 
 * from other artifacts.
