/**
 * The grammar introduces reusable symbols for
 *      Types (of all kinds), 
 *      Functions, 
 *      Variables and 
 *      TypeVariables
 *
 * The symbols are of general nature and do not precluse (and thus also
 * not assist) static, private or other specialities.
 * Extensions of these symbols can be found in the subgrammar
 * OOSymbols that add such specific elements.
 * 
 * This grammar is used to generate an abstract syntax 
 * (and especially symboltable infrastructure) only.
 * These AST-classes are then used to store typing information
 * in the SymbolTable.
 *
 * These symbols can be used in other grammars, when actual implementations
 * of these symbols become available or these symbols need to be imported 
 * from other artifacts.
