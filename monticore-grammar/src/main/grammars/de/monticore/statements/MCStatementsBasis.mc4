/* This is a MontiCore stable grammar.

/**
 * This grammar defines the core interface for statements.
 * A hierarchy of conservative extensions to this grammar realize

 *
 * The language developer may choose the subset of statements
 * of interest 
 *
 * This modularity of statements greatly eases
 * the reuse of statements in languages similar to Java.
 *
 * This grammar is part of a hierarchy of statements, namely
 * * statements/MCStatementsBasis.mc4
 * * -- statements/MCAssertStatements.mc4
 * * -- statements/MCVarDeclarationStatements.mc4
 * * -- -- statements/MCArrayStatements.mc4
 * * -- -- statements/MCCommonStatements.mc4
 * * -- -- -- statements/MCExceptionStatements.mc4
 * * -- -- -- statements/MCSynchronizedStatements.mc4
 * * -- statements/MCLowLevelStatements.mc4
 * * -- statements/MCReturnStatements.mc4
 *
 * and the composition of all statement grammars to full Java:
 * * -- -- statements/MCFullJavaStatements.mc4
