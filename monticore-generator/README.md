This subproject contains fixes from the current monticore-runtime snapshot,
 which are also required in the currently used, last stable, monticore-runtime.  
These "future-ports" are required due to us using the latest se-commons snapshot with the last stable runtime.

The following changes are included:
* Adapt reporting to be based on LogHooks (shipped with runtime 7.7.0)
