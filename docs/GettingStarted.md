# Getting Started with MontiCore

This page describes the technical installation and usage of MontiCore for
language developers. This page further inspects a simple example grammar and the
Java classes and other artifacts generated from this grammar. After installing
MontiCore as described on this page, it can be used to develop new modeling
languages and generators as described in subsequent chapters.

MontiCore provides a command line interface (CLI) tool and can easily be used
with Gradle. The Gradle integration enables developers to easily employ
MontiCore in commonly used integrated development environments (IDEs), such as
Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. We strongly recommend to work through the section
about the CLI tool first. The CLI section contains information about an example
MontiCore project and the files generated by MontiCore. It also shortly explains
some key features of MontiCore.

Detailed information about all configuration options that can be used in
the MontiCore CLI tool and in MontiCore Gradle projects are explained in
[Chapter 16 of the handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). More
information about the example `Automata` language are available in 
[Chapter 21 of the handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

## Prerequisites: Installing the Java Development Kit

We start with the JDK: Please perform the following steps to install the
Java Development Kit (JDK) and validate that the installation was successful:

- Install a JDK with at least version 11 provided by Oracle or OpenJDK.
- Make sure the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to the installed JDK, and
    *not* to the JRE, e.g., the following would be good:
    - `/user/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk` on UNIX or
    - `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.*` on Windows.
    You will need this in order to run the Java compiler for compiling
    the generated Java source files.
- Also make sure that the system variable is set such that the Java
    compiler can be used from any directory. JDK installations on UNIX
    systems do this automatically. On Windows systems, the `bin`
    directory of the JDK installation needs to be appended to the `PATH`
    variable, e.g. `%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%`.
- Test whether the setup was successful. Open a command line shell in
    any directory. Execute the command `javac -version`. If this command
    is recognized and the shell displays the version of the installed
    JDK (e.g., `javac 11.0.5`), then the setup was successful.

Now we have the prerequisites to run MontiCore from the command line.
The JDK installation is also required for using MontiCore with Gradle.

## Install and Use the MontiCore Command Line Interface

This section describes instructions to perform the following first steps
to use MontiCore as an CLI tool:

-   Installation of the MontiCore distribution file.
-   Grammar inspection
-   Running the MontiCore generator
-   Compiling the product
-   Running the product, i.e. the `Automata` tool with an example model
    `example/PingPong.aut`.

### Installation

For installing MontiCore, perform the following steps:

* Download the example `Automata` MontiCore project:
```
// MontiCore zip distribution source
https://www.monticore.de/download/monticore.tar.gz
```
* Unzip the archive. The unzipped files include a directory called
    `mc-workspace` containing the executable MontiCore tool
    `monticore.jar` along with a directory `src` containing
    handwritten `Automata` DSL infrastructure, a directory `hwc`
    containing handwritten code that is incorporated into the generated
    code, and a directory `example` containing an example model of the
    `Automata` DSL.

### Inspect the Example Grammar

MontiCore is a language workbench. It supports developers in developing
modular modelling languages. The core of MontiCore is its grammar
modelling language (cf.Â [Chapter 4 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)), 
which is used by developers for modelling
context-free grammars. A MontiCore grammar defines (parts of) the
abstract and concrete syntax of a language. Each grammar contains
nonterminals, production rules, and may extend other grammars. At most
one rule is marked as the start rule.

It is a *key feature of MontiCore* that it allows a grammar to *reuse and extend other grammars*. 
In an extension all the nonterminals
defined in the extended grammars can be reused or even overridden. This
form of extension allows to achieve several effects:

-   Language (i.e. grammar) components can be reused and integrated in
    larger languages, composed of several components.
-   Individual nonterminals can be reused (like classes) from a library.
-   A given language can be extended, allowing to add additional
    alternatives inside a language.

Component grammars and grammar extensions are detailedly discussed in 
[Chapter 4 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

```monticore
grammar Automata extends de.monticore.MCBasics {

  symbol scope Automaton =
    "automaton" Name "{" (State | Transition)* "}" ;

  symbol State =
    "state" Name
    (("<<" ["initial"] ">>" ) | ("<<" ["final"] ">>" ))*
    ( ("{" (State | Transition)* "}") | ";") ;

  Transition =
    from:Name "-" input:Name ">" to:Name ";" ;
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.2: The <code>Automata</code> grammar.</figcaption>

In the following, we inspect the MontiCore grammar of the `Automata`
language. Navigate your file explorer to the unzipped `mc-workspace`
directory. The directory contains the file `Automata.mc4`. This file
contains the MontiCore grammar depicted in Listing 2.2. MontiCore grammars end with
`.mc4`.

The definition of a MontiCore grammar starts with the keyword `grammar`,
followed by the grammar's name. In this example, the grammar is
called `Automata`. The grammar's name is optionally followed by the
keyword `extends` and a list of grammars that are extended by the
grammar. In this example, the `Automata` grammar extends the grammar
`de.monticore.MCBasics`.

<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-header">
<img src="https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/small_bulb.png" width="25">
Tip 2.3 MontiCore Key Feature: Composition
</div>
<p>The MontiCore language workbench allows to compose language components
by composing grammars and also to reuse all infrastructure, such as
context conditions, symbol table infrastructure, generator parts and
handwritten extensions.</p>

<p>In the example the <code>Automata</code> grammar extends the grammar
<code>de.monticore.MCBasics</code> and thus reuses its functionality.</p>

<p>MontiCore comes with an extensive library of predefined language
components.</p>
</div>

Grammars can also have a package and import other grammars. If a grammar
has a package, then the package declaration must be the first statement
in the grammar and is of the form `package` *QualifiedName* where
`package` is a keyword and *QualifiedName* is an arbitrary qualified
name (e.g. `de.monticore`). The optional grammar imports follow the
package definition. Every import is of the form `import`
*QualifiedName*. The `Automata` example grammar file does neither
contain a package declaration nor imports. The grammar extended by the
`Automata` grammar is specified by its fully qualified name.

As usual in context-free grammars, production rules have a left-hand
side and a right-hand side. The left-hand side contains the possibly
annotated name of a nonterminal. The left-hand side is followed by the
terminal `=` and the right-hand side. Nonterminal names start with an
upper-case letter. For instance, the `Automata` grammar contains the
nonterminals `Automaton`, `State`, and `Transition`. A single
nonterminal can be provided with the `start` keyword. Then, the
nonterminal is the starting symbol of the grammar. If no nonterminal is
marked with `start`, then the first nonterminal of the grammar
becomes the starting symbol by default. In the `Automata` grammar, the
`Automaton` nonterminal is the starting symbol.

The other possible keywords for nonterminals influence the generated
classes for the abstract syntax tree as well as the generated symbol
table infrastructure. Details can be found in 
[Chapter 4 and Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). 
For example, the
`Automaton` nonterminal is marked with `symbol` and `scope`. The
keyword `symbol` makes the MontiCore generator generate a symbol
class for the nonterminal. Intuitively stated, the keyword `scope`
instructs the MontiCore generator to construct a symbol table
infrastructure that
opens a scope when the production is processed. The following sections
explain the effects of specifying the `Automaton` nonterminal with the
keywords `symbol` and `scope` in more detail. Terminals are surrounded
by quotation marks. The `Automata` grammar, for example, inter alia
contains the terminals `automaton`, `state`, `{`, `}`, and `;`.

The right-hand sides of grammar productions consist of nonterminals,
terminals, and semantic predicates, may use cardinalities (`*`, `+`,
`?`), and introduce alternatives via the terminal `|` as known from
regular expressions. Details can be found in 
[Chapter 4 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). 
The right-hand side of
the production defining the nonterminal `Automaton`, for example, uses
the terminal `automaton` and the nonterminals `Name`, `State`, and
`Transition`. The nonterminal `Name` is not defined in the grammar
`Automata`. Thus, it must be defined in one of the extended grammars. In
this case, `Name` is defined in the grammar `MCBasics` and is reused by
the grammar `Automata`. For distinguishing different usages of
nonterminals on right-hand sides, they can be named. For example, the
right-hand side of the production defining the nonterminal `Transition`
uses the `Name` nonterminal twice. The first usage is named `input` and
the second usage is named `to`. MontiCore also supports `interface` and
`external` nonterminals for introducing extension points as detailedly
described in [Chapter 4 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). 
However, the example grammar does not use these concepts.

```automaton
automaton PingPong {
  state NoGame <<initial>>;
  state Ping;
  state Pong <<final>>;

  NoGame - startGame > Ping;

  Ping - stopGame > NoGame;
  Pong - stopGame > NoGame;

  Ping - returnBall > Pong;
  Pong - returnBall > Ping;
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.4: A model conforming to the Automata grammar.</figcaption>

Listing 2.4 depicts an example model conforming to the `Automata` grammar in its
concrete syntax. 
It depicts a simple game of Ping Pong. The automaton consists of three states: 
the initial state `NoGame`, such as the states `Ping` and `Pong`, for 
identifying on which side the ball is located. 
Initially, the automaton starts in the state `NoGame`. 
The game starts at the corresponding event. 
During a run, the automaton switches states by returning the ball from one 
side to the other. 
Additionally, it can be stopped at each stage of the game, resulting in the 
initial configuration.
You can find the model in the file `PingPong.aut`
contained in the `example` directory of the unzipped `mc-workspace`
directory.

### Run MontiCore

The MontiCore generator takes a MontiCore grammar as input and generates
an infrastructure for processing models conforming to the grammar. When
a grammar `E` extends another grammar `G`, then all the
infrastructure generated for the grammar `G` is reused and only the
extending part from `E` is generated.

<img src="https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/small_bulb.png" width="25">
Tip 2.5 Infrastructure Generated by MontiCore
</div>
MontiCore itself as well as the infrastructure generated by the
MontiCore generator are implemented in Java. This infrastructure
includes:

<ul>
<li> a <em>parser</em> for parsing models conforming to the grammar and
    transforming textual models into abstract syntax tree instances
    abstracting from the concrete syntax.</li>
<li> a <em>symbol table infrastructure</em> to handle the symbols introduced or
    used by models conforming to the grammar. The symbol table
    infrastructure is used for resolving dependencies between model
    elements that are possibly defined in different files.</li>
<li> a <em>context-condition checking framework</em> for checking
    well-formedness rules that cannot be captured by context-free
    languages.</li>
<li> a <em>visitor infrastructure</em> for traversing models respectively their
    abstract syntax instances. The abstract syntax of a model consists
    of its internal representation as an abstract syntax tree
    abstracting from the concrete syntax of the model (the instance of
    the data structure obtained from parsing) and the symbol table of
    the model.</li>
<li> a <em>mill infrastructure</em> for retrieving objects for language
    processing, such as parsers, builders for abstract syntax trees,
    visitors and objects for the symbol tables of the language. 
    A mill serves as a dynamic factory, adapting to the current 
    modeling language. The
    possibility to configure the mills is crucial for reusing the
    functionality implemented for a sublanguage (cf. Section 5.9, 
    Section 5.10.2, and Section 11.5 for details).</li>
<li> a <em>code generating framework</em> that extends the 
    <a href="https://freemarker.apache.org/">FreeMarker</a> template
    engine by various modularity enhancing features.</li>
</ul>

</div>

For executing MontiCore using the `Automata` grammar as input, perform
the following steps:

1.  Open a command line shell and change the working directory to the
    unzipped directory (`mc-workspace`).
2.  Execute the following command in order to generate the language
    infrastructure of the `Automata` DSL:
```
java -jar monticore.jar -g Automata.mc4 -hcp hwc/ src/ -mp monticore-rt.jar
```
The only required argument `Automata.mc4` denotes the input grammar
that shall be processed by MontiCore. The processing includes the
generation of the language infrastructure. Using the option `-hcp`
enables specifying the path to a directory containing the
handwritten code that is to be incorporated into the generated
infrastructure. In this case, passing the argument `hwc/` to the
option `-hcp` makes MontiCore consider the handwritten code located
in the directory `hwc/`. Providing handwritten code enables to
easily incorporate additional functionality into the generated code.
For example, this enables developers to extend generated abstract
syntax classes as detailedly described in 
(cf. [Section 5.10 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
Passing the argument `-mp` enables specifying the paths to directories 
or archives 
containing paths to grammars and Java classes that are imported by the 
processed grammar and the related tooling. In this case, the archive 
`monticore-rt.jar` contains the grammars and handwritten extensions
of the [monticore standard library](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/monticore/-/tree/dev/monticore-grammar/src/main).
More information about the standard library can be found in 
[Chapters 17- 20 of the handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

Executing the command launches MontiCore, which results in the
executing of the following steps:

1.  The specified grammar is parsed and processed by MontiCore.
2.  Java source files for the corresponding DSL infrastructure are
    generated into the default output directory `out`. This
    infrastructure consists of the directories
    -   `out/automata/` containing the mill (cf. Section 5.9, Section 5.10.2, Section 11.5).
    -   `out/automata/_ast` containing the abstract syntax tree data
        structure (cf. [Chapter 5 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/automata/_auxiliary` containing adapted mills of sublanguages,
        which are required for configuring the mills of sublanguages
        (cf. [Chapter 11 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/automata/_cocos` containing the infrastructure for context
        conditions (cf. [Chapter 10 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/automata/_od` containing the infrastructure for printing
        object diagrams for reports produced during processing the
        models.
    -   `out/automata/_parser` containing the generated parsers, which are
        based on ANTLR (cf. [Chapter 6 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/automata/_symboltable` containing the infrastructure for the symbol
        table (cf. [Chapter 6 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/automata/_utils` containing infrastructure for typecasting and 
    identifying subtypes of ast nodes, symbols, and scopes.
    -   `out/automata/_visitor` containing the infrastructure for visitors
      (cf. [Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)).
    -   `out/reports/automata` containing reports created during the
      processing of the grammar.
3.  The output directory also contains a log file of the executed
    generation process with the generation time in its name.

In the following, we review the classes and interfaces generated from
the `Automata` grammar that are relevant for language engineers in more
detail. We do not review the classes and interfaces that are only
internally relevant for MontiCore and are usually not intended to be
used by language engineers.

#### Abstract Syntax Tree Data Structure

The tree data structure is generated into the directory `out/automata/_ast`.
Details about the generation of AST classes can be found in 
(cf. [Chapter 5 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf)). For
each nonterminal contained in the grammar, the MontiCore generator
produces AST and corresponding builder classes. The AST classes
implement the abstract syntax tree data structure.

The builder classes implement the builder pattern for constructing
instances of the respective AST classes as usual. For example, the class
`ASTAutomaton` is the AST class generated for the `Automaton`
nonterminal (cf.Â Listing 2.2) and the class `ASTAutomatonBuilder` is the
corresponding generated builder class.

Parts of the AST data structure generated for the `Automata` grammar.

![](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/GenAutomataAST.png)
<figcaption>Figure 2.6: Parts of the AST data structure generated for the <code>Automata</code> grammar.</figcaption>

The contents of the AST and builder classes are generated systematically
from the grammar. The attributes of each AST class resemble the
right-hand side of the corresponding production rule. In the following,
we mainly speak of attributes, but please be aware that all attributes
come fully equipped with access and modification methods, which should
normally be used.

For instance, Figure 2.6 depicts parts of the generated `AST` infrastructure for
the `Automata` grammar. The class `ASTAutomaton` contains the attributes
`name`, `states`, and `transitions`. The `AST` class does not contain an
attribute for the terminal `automaton` as it is part of every word
conforming to the production of the `Automaton` nonterminal. The type of
the attribute `name` is `String` whereas the attributes `states` and
`transitions` are lists of the types of the `AST` classes corresponding
to the used nonterminals. This is the case because exactly one `Name` is
parsed with the right-hand side of the production of the nonterminal
`Automaton`, whereas multiple states and transitions can be parsed.

The `ASTAutomaton` class further contains the attributes `symbol`,
`spannedScope`, and `enclosingScope`. These attributes are specific to
the symbol table of `Automata` models and are used for linking the
symbol table of a model with its abstract syntax tree. Details can be
found in [Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

Tip 2.7 Generated Symbols and Scopes in the AST
</div>
<p>Each <code>AST</code> class contains access to the <code>enclosingScope</code>.</p>

<p>When a production contains the keyword <code>symbol</code>, the generated AST class
contains the attribute <code>symbol</code> 
(see <a href="https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf">Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook</a>).</p>

<p>Keyword <code>scope</code> indicates that a nonterminal also defines a new local
scope, stored in attribute <code>spannedScope</code>.</p>

<p>The parser builds the abstract syntax tree of a model and the available
scope genitor creates the symbol table of the model, consisting of
symbols and scopes.</p>
</div>

The `ASTAutomaton` class further contains several straight-forward
methods for checking different instances for equality and accessing the
attributes. Similar to the `ASTAutomaton` class, the
`ASTAutomatonBuilder` class contains attributes resembling the
right-hand side of the corresponding production. It further contains
methods for changing the values of the attributes (e.g., `addState`),
checking whether the `AST` instance that would be constructed from the
current builder state is valid (cf.Â `isValid`), and for building the
`AST` instance corresponding to the builder's state (cf.Â `build`). The
contents of the other `AST` and `Builder` classes are constructed
analogously.

Tip 2.8 Handwritten AST Class Extensions
</div>
<p>If the generator detects that an <code>AST</code> class for a nonterminal is
already implemented in the handwritten code, then it produces a
corresponding <code>TOP</code> <code>AST</code> class instead.</p>

<p>This TOP mechanism allows developers to add handwritten extensions to
any generated class, while reusing the generated <code>TOP</code> class via
extension.</p>

<p>This gives a <em>very close integration</em> between handwritten and generated
code that even adapts builders accordingly, while preventing the very
bad habit of performing manual changes to the generated code.</p>

<p>Option <code>-hcp</code> tells the generator where to look for handwritten
integrations.</p>
</div>

The following section presents the methods of the classes for parsing
textual models (possibly stored in files) into `AST` class instances at
runtime. For now, it suffices for you to understand that (1) MontiCore
generates an extensible `AST` data structure that resembles the
nonterminals and productions of the grammar in a straight-forward way
and (2) that all models of a grammar have an `AST` data structure
representation for internal processing.

#### Parser

The infrastructure is generated into the directory `out/automata/_parser`.
Details about the generated parsers and their uses are described in 
[Chapter 6 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

Parts of the class `AutomataParser` generated from the `Automata`
grammar.

<figcaption>Figure 2.9: Parts of the class <code>AutomataParser</code> generated from the <code>Automata</code> grammar.</figcaption>

Parts of the generated class `AutomataParser` are depicted in Figure 2.9. The
class implements the generated parser for the `Automata` grammar.
Usually, developers are solely concerned with the methods
`parse(String)` and `parse_String(String)`. For now, it suffices if you
remember that parsing textual `Automata` models stored in files is
possible by calling the method `parse(String)` of an `AutomataParser`
object with the fully qualified name of the file as input.

Tip 2.10 Methods for Parsing
</div>
<p>The class <code>AutomataParser</code> contains the methods</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>parse(Reader r)</code>,</li>
  <li><code>parse(String filename)</code>, and</li>
  <li><code>parse_String(String content)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the methods return an object of type <code>Optional&#x3C;ASTAutomaton&#x3E;</code>,
where absence means failure of parsing and errors have been issued.</p>

<p>For each nonterminal in the grammar, the class further contains methods
for parsing a sub-model described by this nonterminal.</p>
</div>

#### Symbol Table

The infrastructure is generated into the directory `out/automata/_symboltable`.
Details about the generated symbol table infrastructure and its use are
described in [Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). 
The symbol table infrastructure is used for resolving
cross-references concerning information defined in different model
elements that are potentially defined in different models stored in
different files.

  <li><code>AutomataGlobalScope</code></li>
</ul>

<p>as well as respective interfaces. The relationships between these
classes and interfaces are depicted in Figure 2.11.</p>

<p>The singleton <code>AutomataGlobalScope</code> contains all
<code>AutomataArtifactScopes</code> of all loaded <code>Automata</code> artifacts.

Figure 2.13 depicts parts of the symbol classes generated for the `Automata`
grammar. As the nonterminal `State` is annotated with `symbol` in the
`Automata` grammar, the generator produces the class `StateSymbol`. The
`StateSymbol` class, inter alia, contains the attributes `name`,
`enclosingScope`, and `spannedScope`. The attribute `name` stores the
name of the symbol. The attributes `enclosingScope` and `spannedScope`
store the enclosing and spanned scopes of the symbol. The class further
contains methods for accessing and setting the attributes. For all
symbol classes, the MontiCore generator also produces builder classes
(e.g., `AutomataArtifactScopeBuilder` and `StateSymbolBuilder`).

<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-header">
<img src="https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/small_bulb.png" width="25">
Tip 2.14 Extending Symbol Classes
</div>
<p>It is possible to add further methods and attributes in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adding a <em>symbol rule</em> in the grammar 
  (described in <a href="https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf">Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook</a>) or</li>
  <li>using the <em>TOP mechanism</em> applied to the generated symbols.</li>
</ul>
</div>

The generated class `AutomataScopesGenitor` is responsible for creating
the scope structure of `Automata` artifacts and linking the scope
structure with the corresponding `AST` nodes. For this task, it provides
the method `createFromAST` that takes an `ASTAutomaton` instance as
input and returns an `IAutomataArtifactScope` instance. The returned
`IAutomataArtifactScope` instance can be added as a subscope to the
(during runtime unique and administrated by the mill)
`AutomataGlobalScope` instance.

Developers can create visitors for complementing the symbol table
(creating symbols and filling the extensions introduced via symbol rules
or the TOP mechanism) of an `Automata` artifact. After creating the
scope structure, the visitor should be used to traverse the `AST`
instance of the artifact for complementing the symbols and scopes. The
following sections explain the generated visitor infrastructure in more
detail.

```java
Optional<AutomatonSymbol> resolveAutomaton(String name)
List<AutomatonSymbol> resolveAutomatonMany(String name)
Optional<StateSymbol> resolveState(String name)
List<StateSymbol> resolveStateMany(String name)
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.15: Different <code>resolve</code> methods.</figcaption>

For each nonterminal annotated with `symbol` in the grammar `Automata`,
the scope interfaces contain a symbol-specific `resolve` method taking a
string as input. The method can be called to resolve symbol instances by
their names. The name given as input to a `resolve` method should be as
qualified as needed to find the symbol. For instance, Listing 2.15 lists the
signatures of four of the `resolve` methods provided by the interface
`IAutomataScope`.

For now, it suffices for you to understand that (1) MontiCore generates
an extensible symbol table data structure that resembles the scope and
symbol structure as specified in the grammar in a straight-forward way
and (2) that all models of a grammar have a symbol table data structure
representation for internal processing and (3) that symbols can be
resolved from scopes via calling the `resolve` methods.

#### (De)Serialization of Symbol Tables

MontiCore also supports the serialization and deserialization of symbol tables. The
(de)serialization is crucial for incremental code generation and
efficient language composition via aggregation. Details about this are
explained in [Chapter 7 and Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

For the (de)serialization, the generator produces the class
`AutomataSymbol2Json`. It provides the public methods `store` and
`load`. The former can be used to serialize `IAutomataScope` instances
into their string representations encoded in JSON and persisting these
to a file at a location that is passed as method argument. The latter
can be used to load a stored `IAutomataScope` into its objects
representation. For now, it suffices that you understand which methods
to call for the (de)serialization.

#### Visitor

![](https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/GenAutomataVisitors.png)
<figcaption>Figure 2.16: Parts of the visitor infrastructure generated from the <code>Automata</code> grammar</figcaption>

The infrastructure is generated into the directory `out/automata/_visitor`.
Details about the generated visitor infrastructure are described in 
[Chapter 8 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).
For each grammar, the generator systematically produces several classes
and interfaces implementing the visitor infrastructure. For the
`Automata` grammar, for example, the generator produces the interfaces
`AutomataTraverser`, `AutomataVisitor2`, and `AutomataHandler` and the
class `AutomataTraverserImplementation`. The relationships between these
interfaces and classes are depicted in Figure 2.16.

The interfaces `Traverser`, `Visitor2` and `Handler` together realize
the Visitor pattern. Conceptually, the traverser is the entry point for
traversing. The traverser manages visitors for the different
sublanguages and realizes the default traversing strategy. Whenever an
AST node is traversed, the traverser delegates the visit to the
corresponding visitor implementation. If a special traversal is to be
implemented that differs from the default, it is possible to add
handlers to the traverser that realize the alternative traversal. For a
more detailed explanation consider reading 
[Chapter 8 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-header">

Tip 2.17 Visitors
</div>
<p>MontiCore provides the visitor pattern in a detangled and thus flexible
variant.</p>

<p><code>AutomataTraverser</code> is traversing the AST. <code>AutomataVisitor2</code> contain
the actual functionalities, added through subclassing. Many visitors can
be added to the traverser for parallel execution via the method
<code>add4Automata</code>.</p>
</div>

The visitors are compositional, allowing to maximize reuse of visitors
from sublanguages, and they can be adapted through the TOP mechanism.

For example, the handwritten class `PrettyPrinter`, which can be found
in the directory `mc-workspace/src/automata/prettyprint`, implements
functionality for pretty printing an `Automata` model, which is given by
its abstract syntax tree. Listing 2.18 depicts the attributes and the constructor of
the class. The `PrettyPrinter` class implements the `AutomataHandler`
interface. Its constructor instantiates a printer (a helper for printing
indented strings) and retrieves an `AutomataTraverser` object from the
mill (which is explained later on). It sets the handler of the traverser
to itself. This ensures that the pretty printer becomes the handler of
the traverser. We will execute it in a following section.

```java
public class PrettyPrinter implements AutomataHandler {
  private final IndentPrinter printer;
  private AutomataTraverser traverser;

  public PrettyPrinter() {
    this.printer = new IndentPrinter();
    this.traverser = AutomataMill.traverser();
    traverser.setAutomataHandler(this);
  }
// further methods
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.18: Attributes and constructor of the <code>PrettyPrinter</code> for the <code>Automata</code> language.</figcaption>

For now, you should understand that (1) for implementing visitors it is
often sufficient to implement the visitor interfaces and to add them to
a traverser and (2) custom traversals can be realized by implementing
handlers and adding those to the traverser.

#### Context Conditions

The infrastructure is generated into the directory `out/automata/_cocos`.
Details about the generated context condition infrastructure are
described in [Chapter 10 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

For each nonterminal of a grammar, the generator produces a context
condition interface for implementing context conditions for this
nonterminal. For the `Automata` grammar, for example, the generator
produced the interface `AutomataASTStateCoCo`. The interface solely
contains the method `check(ASTState)`. Each class implementing the
interface should represent a predicate over subtrees of abstract syntax
trees starting at a node with the type corresponding to the nonterminal.

The check method should be implemented such that it reports an error or
a warning if the input node does not satisfy the predicate. Thus,
context conditions implement well-formedness rules that cannot be
captured by context-free grammars (or that are intentionally not
captured by the grammar to achieve a specific `AST` data structure). For
producing the error or warning, the static methods `error` and `warning`
of the MontiCore runtime class `Log` should be used.

For the `Automata` grammar, the generator also produced the class
`AutomataCocoChecker`. For each nonterminal of the grammar, the class
contains a method for adding context condition instances to an
`AutomataCocoChecker` instance. For checking whether an `AST` node
satisfies all registered context conditions, the method `checkAll` can
be called with the `AST` node as input. Calling the method makes the
checker traverse the abstract syntax tree and check whether each node
satisfies the context conditions registered for the node. Thus,
`AutomataCocoChecker` instances represent sets of context conditions
that are required to be satisfied by abstract syntax tree instances.

For now, you should understand that (1) implementing context conditions
is possible via implementing the generated `CoCo` interfaces and (2)
context conditions can be checked via instantiating the `Checker` class,
adding the CoCos, and calling the `checkAll` method.

#### Mill as Factory for Builders

The for the `Automata` language is generated into the directory
`out/automata/`. Details about the generated mill and the mill pattern
in general are described in Section 11.5. The generated mill class `AutomataMill` is
responsible for providing ready to use and correct parser, scope
genitor, scope, and builder instances. The mill of each language is a
singleton.

<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-header">
<img src="https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/small_bulb.png" width="25">
Tip 2.19 Mill Use and Automatic Initialization
</div>
<p>A mill is a factory for builders and other commonly used functions, such
as parsers or visitors. The mill was introduced to ensure
compositionality of languages, while retaining reusability of functions
developed for sublanguages.</p>

<p>Only one mill instance exists, even though in composed languages it is
available under several static signatures. Let language <code>G2</code> extend
another language <code>G1</code>. Then <code>G2Mill</code> initializes the <code>G1Mill</code>
appropriately, such that all the code of the sublanguage <code>G1</code> can be
reused in the tools developed for the language <code>G2</code>, even when creating
new AST nodes, symbols, etc.</p>

<p>Cool mechanism and the developers don't have to bother.</p>
</div>

```java
public static IAutomataGlobalScope globalScope()
public static IAutomataArtifactScope artifactScope()
public static IAutomataScope scope()
public static AutomataScopesGenitor scopesGenitor ()
public static AutomataScopesGenitorDelegator scopesGenitorDelegator()
public static ASTAutomatonBuilder automatonBuilder()
public static AutomatonSymbolBuilder automatonSymbolBuilder()
public static AutomataParser parser()
public static AutomataTraverser traverser ()
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.20: Some method of the <code>AutomataMill</code>.</figcaption>

Developers should retrieve all instances of the classes and interfaces
provided by the mill by using the mill. Instances of the classes and
interfaces that are provided by the mill should never be instantiated
manually. Otherwise, it may be the case that not all of the code
implemented for the language can be reused as expected in other
languages extending the language. Listing 2.20 shows some signatures of the methods
of the `AutomataMill`.

<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-header">
<img src="https://github.com/MontiCore/monticore/raw/opendev/docs/docs/small_bulb.png" width="25">
Tip 2.12 Mill Methods
</div>
<p>A mill provides <code>public static</code> methods for retrieving the instances of
the parsers, scope genitors, scopes, and builders. For that is acts like
a factory. Because a mill is realized using the static delegator pattern
(cf. Section 11.1), it still can be adapted at will.</p>

<p>This combines the advantage of general availability with the advantage
of being able to override the functions.</p>
</div>

For now, you should understand that (1) the methods of the mill should
be used for creating ready to use and correct parser, scope genitor,
scope, and builder instances and (2) how to call these methods.

### Compile the Target

[Section 2.2.3 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf) 
describes how to generate the desired Java code
from a MontiCore grammar. For these Java classes, generated for the
`Automata` DSL, execute the following command in the mc-workspace:

**With Powershell on Windows**
```powershell
javac -cp monticore-rt.jar -sourcepath "src/;out/;hwc/" `
                                  src/automata/AutomataTool.java
```
**With Bash on Unix**
```bash
javac -cp monticore-rt.jar -sourcepath "src/:out/:hwc/" \
                                  src/automata/AutomataTool.java
```
**With cmd on Windows**
```batch
javac -cp monticore-rt.jar -sourcepath "src/;out/;hwc/" ^
                                  src/automata/AutomataTool.java
```

Please note, on Unix systems paths are separated using ":" (colon)
instead of semicolons.

Providing the option `-cp` with the argument `monticore-cli.jar` makes
the Java compiler consider the compiled MontiCore runtime classes
contained in the file `monticore-cli.jar`.

The option `-sourcepath` enables to specify paths to directories
containing the source files that should be considered during the
compilation.

In this case, executing the command makes the Java compiler consider all
generated classes located in and all handwritten classes located in `src` and `hwc`. 
The last argument instructs the Java compiler to compile the class
`src/automata/AutomataTool.java`.

Please note that the structure of the handwritten classes follows the
package layout of the generated code, i.e. there are the following sub
directories (Java packages):

-   `src/automata` contains the top-level language realization for using
    the generated DSL infrastructure. In this case the class
    `src/automata/AutomataTool.java` constitutes a main class executable
    for processing automata models with the automata DSL.
-   `src/automata/cocos` contains infrastructure for context condition
    of the automata DSL.
-   `src/automata/prettyprint` contains an exemplary use of the
    generated visitor infrastructure for processing parsed models for
    pretty printing.
-   `src/automata/visitors` contains an exemplary analysis using the
    visitor infrastructure. The exemplary analysis counts the states
    contained in the parsed automata model.
-   `hwc/automata/_ast` contains an exemplary usage of the handwritten
    code integration mechanism for modifying the AST for the automata
    DSL. Details about the integration mechanism are described in Section 5.10.
-   `hwc/automata/_symboltable` contains handwritten extensions of the
    generated symbol table infrastructure. Details about implementing
    handwritten symbol table infrastructure extensions are described in 
    [Chapter 9 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).

Please, also do not mix the code for the `Automata` tool vs. the code
for the final product, generated from that tool, although both have a
similar package structure.

We already described the contents of the directories `hwc/automata/_ast`
and `hwc/automata/_symboltable` in the previous section. They contain
handwritten extensions of the abstract syntax of the `Automata`
language.

```java
public class CountStates implements AutomataVisitor2 {
  private int count = 0;

  @Override
  public void visit(ASTState node) {
    count++;
  }

  public int getCount() {
    return count;
  }
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.22: The <code>CountStates</code> visitor implementation</figcaption>

The directory `src/automata/visitors` contains the file
`CountStates.java`. The class is depicted in Listing 2.22. It implements a simple
visitor for counting the number of states contained in an `Automata`
model. To this effect, it implements the `AutomataVisitor2` interface.
It has an attribute `count` of type `int` for storing the current number
of counted nodes. It overrides the `visit` method for `ASTState` to
increase the counter whenever a state is visited.

The directory `src/automata/cocos` contains the context-condition
implementations for the `Automata` language.

```java
public class AtLeastOneInitialAndFinalState
       implements AutomataASTAutomatonCoCo {
@Override
  public void check(ASTAutomaton automaton) {
    boolean initialState = false;
    boolean finalState = false;
    
    for (ASTState state : automaton.getStateList()) {
      if (state.isInitial()) {
        initialState = true;
      }
      if (state.isFinal()) {
        finalState = true;
      }
    }
    
    if (!initialState || !finalState) {
      // Issue error...
      Log.error("0xA0116 An automaton must have at least one initial 
                 and one final state.",
          automaton.get_SourcePositionStart());
    }
  }
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.23: Context condition implementation for checking that
there exist at least one initial and at least one
final state.</figcaption>

Listing 2.23 depicts the class `AtLeastOneInitialAndFinalState`. The class implements
a context condition for checking whether an `Automata` model contains at
least one initial and at least one final state. To this effect, the
class implements the interface `AutomataASTAutomatonCoCo`. The class
`StateNameStartsWithCapitalLetter` is implemented similarly.

```java
public class TransitionSourceExists
                 implements AutomataASTTransitionCoCo {

  @Override
  public void check(ASTTransition node) {
  
    IAutomataScope enclosingScope = node.getEnclosingScope();
    Optional<StateSymbol> sourceState =
        enclosingScope.resolveState(node.getFrom());

    if (!sourceState.isPresent()) {
      // Issue error...
      Log.error(
        "0xADD03 Source state of transition missing.",
         node.get_SourcePositionStart());
    }
  }
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.24: Context condition implementation for checking that
states used in transitions exist.</figcaption>

Listing 2.24 presents the implementation of the class `TransitionSourceExists`. The
class implements a context condition for checking whether the source
states used in transitions are defined. To this effect, the class uses
the resolving mechanisms of the symbol table. For each transition, the
context conditions tries to resolve the state symbol corresponding to
the source state of the transition. If the resolving fails for the
state, then the context condition logs an error.

The class `AutomataTool` is the main class of the `Automata` language.
It is defined in the file `AutomataTool.java` contained in the directory
`src/automata`.

```java
public class AutomataTool extends AutomataToolTOP {
  // main method missing in this listing

  public ASTAutomaton parse(String model) {
    try {
      AutomataParser parser = new AutomataParser() ;
      Optional<ASTAutomaton> optAutomaton = parser.parse(model);

      if (!parser.hasErrors() && optAutomaton.isPresent()) {
        return optAutomaton.get();
      }
      Log.error("0xEE840 Model could not be parsed.");
    }
    catch (RecognitionException | IOException e) {
      Log.error("0xEE640 Failed to parse " + model, e);
    }
    System.exit(1);
    return null;
  }
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.25: Methods for parsing and creating symbol tables.</figcaption>

Listing 2.25 presents the implementation of the method `parse` of the `AutomataTool` 
class which can be used for parsing `Automata` models. The class extends the 
generated abstract superclass `AutomataToolTOP` that provides methods to be used in
the `run` method. One example is the method `createSymbolTable` that uses the global scope 
and genitors available in the mill to create a symbol table for `Automata`. 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  // delegate main to instantiatable method for better integration,
  // reuse, etc.
  new AutomataTool().run(args);
}

public void run(String[] args) {

  // use normal logging (no DEBUG, TRACE)
  AutomataMill.init();
  Log.ensureInitialization();

  Options options = initOptions();
  try {
    //create CLI Parser and parse input options from commandline
    CommandLineParser cliparser = new org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser();
    CommandLine cmd = cliparser.parse(options, args);

    //help: when --help
    if (cmd.hasOption("h")) {
      printHelp(options);
      //do not continue, when help is printed.
      return;
    }
    //version: when --version
    else if (cmd.hasOption("v")) {
      printVersion();
      //do not continue when help is printed
      return;
    }

    Log.info("Automata DSL Tool", "AutomataTool");

    if (cmd.hasOption("i")) {
      String model = cmd.getOptionValue("i");
      final ASTAutomaton ast = parse(model);
      Log.info(model + " parsed successfully!", "AutomataTool");

      AutomataMill.globalScope().setFileExt("aut");
      IAutomataArtifactScope modelTopScope = createSymbolTable(ast);
      // can be used for resolving things in the model
      Optional<StateSymbol> aSymbol = modelTopScope.resolveState("Ping");
      if (aSymbol.isPresent()) {
        Log.info("Resolved state symbol \"Ping\"; FQN = "
            + aSymbol.get().toString(),
          "AutomataTool");
      } else {
        Log.info("This automaton does not contain a state called \"Ping\";",
          "AutomataTool");
        }
      runDefaultCoCos(ast);

      if(cmd.hasOption("s")){
        String storeLocation = cmd.getOptionValue("s");
        storeSymbols(modelTopScope, storeLocation);
      }
 
      // analyze the model with a visitor
      CountStates cs = new CountStates();
      AutomataTraverser traverser = AutomataMill.traverser();
      traverser.add4Automata(cs);
      ast.accept(traverser);
      Log.info("Automaton has " + cs.getCount() + " states.", "AutomataTool");
      prettyPrint(ast,"");
    }else{
      printHelp(options);
    }
  } catch (ParseException e) {
    // e.getMessage displays the incorrect input-parameters
    Log.error("0xEE752 Could not process AutomataTool parameters: " + e.getMessage());
  }
}
```
<figcaption>Listing 2.26: Main method of the <code>AutomataTool</code> class</figcaption>

The `AutomataTool` provides a `main` method, which can be called from
the command line. The implementation of the method is depicted in Listing 2.26. It
expects two inputs. The first is the name of a file containing an
`Automata` model. The second input is the name of the file in which the
tool should store the symbol table of the model given as first input.

The method

-   parses the input model,
-   creates the symbol table,
-   resolves a state,
-   executes context conditions,
-   stores the symbol table by using the serialization,
-   executes the visitor for counting the states, and
-   pretty prints the model to the standard output.

Inspect the main method and try to understand the implementation for the
executed tasks. Read the above descriptions again if necessary.

### Run the Tool

The previous command compiles the handwritten and generated code
including the `Automata` tool class `AutomataTool`. For running the
`Automata` DSL tool, execute the following command:

**With Powershell on Windows**
```powershell
java -cp "src/;out/;hwc/;monticore-rt.jar" `
                    automata.AutomataTool -i example/PingPong.aut `
                    -s st/PingPong.autsym
```
**With Bash on Unix**
```bash
java -cp "src/:out/:hwc/:monticore-rt.jar" \
                    automata.AutomataTool -i example/PingPong.aut \
                    -s st/PingPong.autsym
```
**With cmd on Windows**
```batch
java -cp "src/;out/;hwc/;monticore-rt.jar" ^
                    automata.AutomataTool -i example/PingPong.aut ^
                    -s st/PingPong.autsym
```

Please note again, on Unix systems paths are separated using ":"
(colon) instead of semicolons. Executing the command runs the `Automata`
DSL tool.

Using the option `-cp` makes the Java interpreter consider the compiled
classes contained in the paths specified by the argument.

The argument `automata.AutomataTool` makes the Java interpreter execute
the main method of the class `automata.AutomataTool` contained in the
directory `src`.

The argument `example/PingPong.aut` is passed to the main method of the
`Automata` DSL tool class as input. Inspect the output on the command
line, which displays log messages concerning the processing of the
example `Automata` model.

The last argument `st/PingPong.autsym` is also passed to the main
method. It makes the tool store the serialized symbol table of the input
model into the file `example/PingPong.aut`.

The shipped example `Automata` DSL (all sources contained in
`mc-workspace/src` and `mc-workspace/hwc`) can be used as a starting
point for creating your own language. It can easily be altered to
specify your own DSL by adjusting the grammar and the handwritten Java
sources and rerunning MontiCore as described above.

## Using MontiCore via Gradle From the Command Line

It is possible to execute MontiCore via the MontiCore plugin. A detailed
description about using the MontiCore Gradle plugin is given in 
[Chapter 16 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf). This
section describes the execution of MontiCore via a Gradle plugin from
the command line shell by example. Before you start, 
[install gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
and make sure that you can use it from the command line.

The shipped example `Automata` DSL can be used as a starting point and
can be downloaded here:

```
https://www.monticore.de/download/Automaton.zip
```

The build script (file `build.gradle`) can easily be adapted for creating build
scripts for other languages. For executing MontiCore via the Gradle
plugin from the command line shell by example of the `Automata` DSL,
perform the following steps:

1.  Download the `Automata` example.
2.  Unzip the downloaded zip file into an arbitrary directory.
3.  Open a shell and change your working directory to the directory in
    which you unzipped the downloaded file (the directory containing the
    file `build.gradle`).
4.  Execute Gradle in the shell:
    -   If you are using a Windows shell, execute the command
        `gradle build`.
    -   If you are using a Unix shell, execute the command
        `./gradle build`.

When executing the above commands, MontiCore launches, which results in
the execution of the following steps:

1.  The grammars specified in the build.gradle are incrementally parsed
    and processed by MontiCore.
2.  Java source files for the corresponding DSL infrastructure are
    generated into the default output directory
    `../target/generated-sources/monticore/sourcecode`. The contents of
    this generated directory are equal to the contents of the generated
    directory `out` as described in .

## Using MontiCore in Eclipse

The MontiCore plugin can be used in Eclipse. Section 2.4.1 describes the process of setting
up Eclipse. Section 2.4.2 presents how to import the example project in Eclipse.
Finally, Section 2.4.3 explains how the MontiCore Gradle plugin can be executed in
Eclipse.

### Setting up Eclipse

Before you import the example project and run MontiCore as a Gradle
plugin, please make sure that a current version of the Gradle plugin is
installed in Eclipse. When installing a new version of Eclipse, the
Gradle plugin is installed by default. If the Gradle plugin is not yet
integrated into your Eclipse installation, download the latest Eclipse
version or perform the following steps to install the Eclipse plugin:

1.  Download and install Eclipse (or use an existing one).
2.  Open Eclipse.
3.  Install the needed Plugins.
    -   Help \> Eclipse Marketplace\...
    -   Type 'gradle' in the search box and click Enter.
    -   Install the 'Buildship Gradle Integration' plugin.
4.  Make sure to configure Eclipse to use an JDK instead of an JRE.
    -   Window \> Preferences \> Java \> Installed JREs.

### Importing the Example

The shipped example `Automata` DSL can be used as a starting point. Once
imported into Eclipse, it can easily be altered to specify your own DSL
by adjusting the grammar and the handwritten Java sources and rerunning
MontiCore as described in Section 2.4.3. To import the example, perform the following
steps:

1.  Download and unzip the `Automata` example:
```
http://www.monticore.de/download/Automaton.zip
```
2.  Open Eclipse and select
    -   File \> Import \> Gradle (if you are required to choose a Gradle
        version, then choose version 7.6.4) \> Existing Gradle
        Projects \> Next.
    -   Click on the *Browse..* button and import the directory that
        contains the file `build.gradle` from the `Automata` example.

### Running MontiCore

To execute the MontiCore Gradle plugin, perform the following steps:

-   Select the *Gradle Task* menu (at the top or bottom, depending on
    your installed Eclipse version).
-   There select automaton \> build \> build (double click).

This makes Eclipse execute the MontiCore Gradle plugin as described in 
[Section 2.3 of the MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf) .
After installing and executing MontiCore in Eclipse, your workspace
should look similar to Figure 2.27.

The MontiCore plugin can be used in IDEA. Section 2.5.1 describes the process of
setting up IntelliJ IDEA. Afterwards, Section 2.5.2 presents how to import the example
project in Eclipse. Finally, Section 2.5.3 explains how the MontiCore Gradle plugin
can be executed in IntelliJ IDEA.

### Setting up IntelliJ IDEA

For setting up IntelliJ IDEA, perform the following steps:

1.  Download and install IntelliJ IDEA (or use your existing installation).
    -   Hint for Students: You get the Ultimate version of IntelliJ IDEA
        for free.
2.  Open IntelliJ IDEA.

### Importing the Example

The shipped example `Automata` DSL can be used as a starting point. Once
imported into IntelliJ IDEA, it can easily be altered to specify your
own DSL by adjusting the grammar and the handwritten Java sources and
rerunning MontiCore as described in Section 2.5.3. For importing the example, perform
the following steps:

1.  Download and unzip the `Automata` example:
```
http://www.monticore.de/download/Automaton.zip
```
2.  In the IDE select: File \> Open.
3.  Select the directory containing the build.gradle (if you are
    required to choose a Gradle version, then choose version 6.7.1).

### Running MontiCore

To execute the MontiCore Gradle plugin, perform the following steps:

-   Select the Gradle Projects menu on the right.
-   From there select automaton \> Tasks\> build \> build (double click).

This makes IntelliJ IDEA execute the Gradle plugin as described in Section 2.3. If
you do not see the Gradle Projects menu yet, right-click on the
build.gradle file and select 'Import Gradle Project'. Now the Gradle
Projects menu should occur on the right side and you can follow the
above mentioned steps for the execution. After installing and executing
MontiCore in IntelliJ IDEA, your workspace should look similar to Figure 2.28.

## Using MontiCore with GitPod

Installing all the prerequisites and an IDE can take some time.
Alternatively to this, you can use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io), an open-source
Kubernetes application for ready-to-code developer environments. It already
has all the prerequisites and an operational Web IDE similar to Microsoft's
Visual Studio Code installed. You need to login with an existing GitHub account
to use it. 

[This link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MontiCore/automaton) can be used
to access the Gitpod project for the `Automata` language.
First, an environment for the project with the proper Java and Gradle version
will be prepared and initialized automatically.
After that, you will be directed to the Web IDE. The project will be built
with Gradle first, and after that it is ready-to-use. The Web IDE also has a 
built-in terminal which can be used to build the project via `gradle build` 
or execute other tasks. 

The Web IDE can be used to change existing project files, such as the `Automata`
grammar or the handwritten classes for the language. Simply navigate to the grammars
or classes in the file explorer on the left-hand side of the IDE and edit the files. 
This makes experimenting with MontiCore possible. The changes will be compiled by the
IDE immediately and compilation errors will be marked with red color. To run the project,
execute the command `gradle build` in the terminal.

You will notice that the link to the Gitpod project is generated and always
has the same pattern.
An example for a link is https://indigo-ostrich-8psdfoer.ws-eu18.gitpod.io.
After 30 minutes of non-use, Gitpod will "freeze" the environment.
It can be reactivated by using the same link to access it. The environment is
reactivated, and you do not even need to rebuild the project with Gradle to use
the project again.
