by executing the following configuration: 

    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    
## Build MontiCore

MontiCore is currently built using Gradle. 

Please note that from the top level build script, not everything is built and 
all tests executed. It is a deliberate decision, to exclude some of the longer 
lasting tasks.

* build the productive code (including the unit tests, ~8 min)
  * `gradle buildMC`
  * skipping the unit tests: `gradle assembleMC`
* run integration tests (which are not included in the unit tests, ~30 min)   
  * all integration tests
    * `gradle testIT`
  * Integration tests of the generator: 
    *  `gradle -p monticore-test/it build`
  * EMF Integration tests of the generator (only test collection not included in `testIt`): 
    * `gradle -p monticore-test/it build -PbuildProfile=emf`
  * Experiments (from the Reference Manual) as integration tests:
    * `gradle -p monticore-test/01.experiments build` and 
    * `gradle -p monticore-test/02.experiments build`
  * Grammar integration tests:
     * `gradle -p monticore-test/monticore-grammar-it build`
* clean:
  * call `gradle clean`
  * cleaning integration tests:
    * using gradle `gradle clean` within the corresponding subproject (see above)
