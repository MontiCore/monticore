# MontiCore Best Practices - A Guide For Small Solutions

[MontiCore](https://www.monticore.de) provides a number of options to design 
languages, access and modify the abstract syntax tree, and produce output files.

This (currently unsorted and evolving) list of practices discusses solutions 
that we identified and applied as well as alternatives and their specific 
advantages and drawbacks. The list also mentions where the solutions have been
found and where they have been applied first.

The list is subdivided into several MD files tackling various language design areas.

The list is partially temporary and also contains compact (incomplete) solutions.
More detailed descriptions of best practices can be found in the 
[MontiCore handbook](https://www.monticore.de/handbook.pdf).
Some of the best practices here will also be incorporated in the next version
of the handbook.
