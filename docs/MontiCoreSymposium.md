## Third MontiCore Symposium 23. March - 26. March 2025

MontiCore is a language workbench designed for the efficient 
development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) along with their 
corresponding tooling. It provides a robust infrastructure to define, 
manipulate, and process languages, supporting features such as 
model-to-model transformations and code generation, enhancing 
productivity in software development projects.

The goals of the MontiCore symposium are primarily to bring together 
researchers, developers, and users of the MontiCore language workbench 
to discuss advancements, share experiences, and explore new ideas in 
the domain of domain-specific languages (DSLs). 

It aims to foster collaboration and exchange on topics such as language 
design, model-driven software development, tool integration, and 
practical applications of MontiCore in various fields, including SysML 
v2 and UML. This symposium provides a platform for presenting 
innovative research, networking, and discussing challenges and 
solutions in the context of DSLs and model-based development. 



### Location

The MontiCore symposium will be located in Gemünd, Germany. 

### Participation

Participation is based on acceptance of an abstract or a full paper and 
requires registration until **07th of March**. 

Registration costs tba and include accommodation, 
conference fees, and meals during the symposium as well as coordinated a 
bus transfer from Dusseldorf airport or Aachen and the venue.  

### Submission

Submissions must adhere to the ACM formatting instructions, which can 
be found here. We ask for two types of contributions: 

 [1] Research papers: 8 pages,
 [2] Vision abstracts: 1 page.
 
Submissions must be uploaded through [EasyChair via this link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mcs25). 

It is planned to produce post-proceedings with extended and improved 
versions of the papers as result of the symposium. 

### Important Dates (deadlines extended) 
 * **10.01.2025**: Paper Submission Deadline 
 * **28.02.2025**: Acceptance Notification 
 * **07.03.2025**: Registration Deadline 
 * **23.03.2025-26.03.2025**: MontiCore Symposium 


### Call for Papers

We solicit talk proposals concerning the application, development, and 
innovation of language engineering or model-driven development around 
the language workbench MontiCore. Topics of interest include, but are 
not limited to:  
  
* Novel meta-languages for language construction and composition  

* Holistic approaches to language engineering in MontiCore that 
cross-cut multiple language aspects (e.g., abstract and concrete 
syntax, semantics, transformations) and/or integrate with program 
analysis, validation, testing, or other advanced techniques.  

* Industrial case studies: experience reports, large-scale evaluations, 
best practices, and human factors to adoption.   
  * Model-Based DevOps
  * Domain-specific solutions in application domains, such as 
    Automotive, CPS, IOT, Production, Quantum Computing, Avionics,
    HealthCare, Energy, Robotics. 

* MontiCore for Research Software Engineering

* Low-Code / No-Code approaches based on MontiCore  
  * Languages for describing and deriving digital twins  
  * Languages for non-engineering issues, such as science, legal, 
    social, or environmental sustainability issues  
  * DSLs engineered on the basis of GPMLs, like SysML and UML

* AI-based methods for language engineering and modeling within the 
MontiCore ecosystem  

* MontiCore languages in action: Academic and industrial application of 
MontiCore and its languages  
  * SysML v2 parser advancements
  * UMLP tooling
  * MontiArc architecture tools
  * MontiGem webapp development 

Presenters are encouraged to accompany their presentations with a 
**demo** or **reproduction package** that helps the participants to 
(easily) run and comprehend the presented tools, experiment with them, 
or tweak benchmark experiments. This helps to create a lasting 
contribution.
